## Project Name: Image Processing and Deep Learning For Low-Resolution RF-SAR Imagery
### Started date: Sep.
### Finish date: 31th.Apr.2021
## Description:
### The project is about using a RESUNET for satellite images segmentation, aims to achieve automated mapping and segment satellites images rather than do it manually. The project mainly divide into two parts: image preprocessing and model building and training. The challenge is to train the pretrained model - ResNet50 and modified U-Net model.
